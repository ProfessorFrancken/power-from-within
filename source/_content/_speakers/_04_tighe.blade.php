		<em>Materials in the space environment</em>

<p class="ribbon__items news-item__body">
	Space can be a harsh environment for materials, and understanding the potential degradation mechanisms is key to building
	spacecraft and scientific instruments which will remain functional for the lifetime of the mission. In some respects, this
	is no different to other terrestrial applications. For example, a manufacturer of a commercial paint for the outside of
	a house needs to know how the paint will degrade after exposure to prolonged periods of sunlight, humidity, temperature
	excursions, and possibly other environments such as salt spray. So what is unique about the space environment and what characterises
	a “space material” ? Why isn’t the standard commercial paint suitable for use on the outside of a spacecraft ? Key factors
	are functionality, reliability and survivability. The challenges of selecting and testing materials for different types
	of space mission will be presented, using examples from on-going ESA space projects. One example is the BepiColombo science
	mission to Mercury, where the external spacecraft materials will need to operate at high temperature whilst exposed to very
	high intensity UV radiation. It will be shown that the solar array materials could be particularly vulnerable to degradation.
	Another example is the Aeolus wind observatory, an Earth Observation mission which will utilise a high power UV laser to
	measure the velocity profile of the winds in the upper atmosphere. The key challenge here is to mitigate the risk of laser
	induced contamination caused by vacuum outgassing of materials in the vicinity of the laser’s sensitive optical components.

	Dr. Adrian Tighe has been a Materials Engineer in the Directorate of Technology, Engineering and Quality at the European
	Space Agency in ESTEC since 2001. He supports the ESA space projects and works with ESA’s industrial partners on all issues
	related to the effects of the space environment on materials and coatings, with the direct involvement of the ESTEC materials
	and components test laboratories. He has also developed a small materials exposure experiment for an ISS external payload.
	Before joining ESA, he obtained his Pd.D. and held a post doc post at the University of Southampton, UK, performing research
	into the effects of high velocity space debris particle impacts on materials. He has (co)-authored a number of journal and
	conference publications related to space environmental effects and laser damage of materials, and he is also a chartered
	member of the Institute of Physics (UK).
