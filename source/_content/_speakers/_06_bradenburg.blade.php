		<em>Radiation hardness of electronics</em>

<p class="ribbon__items news-item__body">
	The earth is constantly bombarded by high energy protons, alpha-particles and heavier nuclei originating from the sun and
	many other galactic and extra-galactic sources with energies. The energy deposited directly or indirectly by these ionizing
	particles in matter may cause various types of damage in any electronic component in satellites, airplanes and, despite
	shielding by the atmosphere, even in equipment at the surface of earth such as the computers in cars and the HV-rectifiers
	in high speed trains. With the increasing miniaturization of integrated electronics the ionizing radiation induced damage
	is becoming an ever more important issue from both a safety and an economic perspective. Significant research efforts to
	improve our fundamental understanding of the damage processes as well as the methods to assess radiation hardness are undertaken
	to mitigate the impact of radiation damage in electronics.

	Sytze Brandenburg is professor in accelerator physics at the University of Groningen. After studying physics in Groningen
	and Helsinki, Finland he did his PhD research in experimental nuclear physics at the Kernfysisch Versneller Instituut (KVI),
	Groningen, the Netherlands. From 1986 to 1994 he worked at the Institut de Physique Nucl√©aire, Orsay, France on the design,
	construction and commissioning of the superconducting cyclotron AGOR, that is operational at the KVI-CART since 1996. Since
	1999 he is directing the R&D on accelerators and their applications at KVI-CART. Besides his main research topic, the further
	development of radiotherapy with ion beams, he works with ESA, CERN and other partners on getting a better understanding
	of the assessment of radiation hardness of electronics components.
