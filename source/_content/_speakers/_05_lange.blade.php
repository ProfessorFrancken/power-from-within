		<em>The Herschel HIFI instrument</em>

<p class="ribbon__items news-item__body">
	Dr. Ir. Gert de Lange studied Applied Physics at the TU-Eindhoven and the University of Groningen. He obtained his PhD at
	the University of Groningen in 1994, with a thesis on the development of quantum limited superconducting tunnel junctions
	for the detection of terahertz radiation. After this he joined the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to work on the
	development of MEMS based superconducting detector arrays. In 1998 he joined SRON Netherlands Institute for Space Research
	where he lead a team that developed superconducting heterodyne detectors for the HIFI instrument on the ESA Herschel mission.
	Herschel/HIFI was launched in 2009. Following on HIFI he worked on several other projects with superconducting detectors
	for ground-based, balloon-borne and air-borne receivers, His currentwork is on several future space missions, including
	Athena (X-ray), PLATO (exo planets), and SPICA (infrared).

	In the presentation the development of the Herschel satellite will be presented, with a focus on the HIFI instrument as developed
	by SRON. HIFI is a heterodyne spectrometer operating from 0.48 to 1.8 THz. Cold star-forming regions in space (the &quot;birth
	chamber&quot; of stars) emit light at these frequencies, but the earth atmosphere blocks most of this radiation. Herschel
	therefore gave a unique view on a previously unobserved sky. The presentation will cover the different phases within the
    project, from early ideas and developments, up to the gathering of unique science data in space.
