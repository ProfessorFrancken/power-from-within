		<em>Space for Science</em>

<p class="ribbon__items news-item__body">
	The launch of the first Sputnik in 1957 opened up a whole new field of research, known as space science. Bringing instruments
	into Earth orbit and beyond enabled in-situ measurements of cosmic phenomena that cannot be probed from the ground, like
	space weather and our planet’s climate. Space telescopes also provided astronomers with a view of the universe at wavelengths
	that cannot be seen from the surface of the Earth, including X-rays and gamma rays. Moreover, spaceflight gave us the opportunity
	of actually visiting other worlds, like the Moon and the planets. It’s fair to say that astronomy and Earth science have
	both been revolutionized by opening up the space frontier.

	In his presentation, astronomy journalist Govert Schilling will describe varous aspects of space science, concentrating on
	the exciting new results yielded by unmanned satellites and space telescopes. He will also question the importance of human
	presence in space, by discussing scientific experiments carried out in the International Space Station, and the necessity
	of human spaceflight to Mars. Finally, he will provide a look into the near future, highlighting a few impressive space
	science projects that may be realized over the next decades.

	Govert Schilling is a self-employed (and self-taught) astronomy and space science journalist, working for Dutch, British
	and American publications, including de Volkskrant, Eos Magazine, New Scientist, Sky at Night Magazine, Science, and Sky
	& Telescope. He wrote over 50 books on various aspects of astronomy, including a number of children’s books and stargazing
	guides. Some of his books have been translated in English, German and Chinese, to name just a few. His most recent book
	is Ripples in Spacetime: Einstein, Gravitational Waves, and the Future of Astronomy (Harvard University Press, July 2017),
	about the hunt for gravitational waves. He is often asked to comment on astronomical discoveries on Dutch radio and TV shows.
	In 2017, the International Astronomical Union named asteroid (10986) Govert in his honor.
