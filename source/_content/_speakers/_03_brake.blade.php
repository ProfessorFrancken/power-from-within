		<em>(Vibration-free) Cryogenic Cooling in Space</em>
	</h3>
</p>
<p class="ribbon__items news-item__body">
	Prof. dr. Marcel ter Brake received his doctoral degree in 1986 at the University of Twente (UT) after which he became member
	of the Low Temperature Division at UT. Focus of his work was the realization of a Biomagnetic Center equipped with a magnetically
	shielded room and home-made multichannel SQUID-based neuromagnetometers. Starting in the mid 90’s Ter Brake’s research shifted
	to MEMS-based cryogenic coolers and sorption-based compressors combined with Joule-Thomson coolers. The latter type of coolers
	are thermally driven and therefore generate no measurable vibrations. This is an extremely important advantage as compared
	to the conventional mechanical coolers when applied for cooling optical detector systems. Over the last 15 years several
	projects ran (and still run) at UT sponsored by the European Space Agency. </p>

	Marcel ter Brake was appointed as Professor at the UT in 2010 and holds the chair of Energy, Materials and Systems. He chairs
	the International Cryogenic Engineering Committee as well as the Cryogenic Society of Europe, and is member of the American
	Cryogenic Society and board member of the European Society for Applied Superconductivity.

	Optical instruments are crucial in Earth observation as well as in scientific space missions. In order to increase the resolution
	of these optical instruments, the optics and the optical detector need to be cooled to reduce the thermal noise contribution.
	Furthermore, cooling is needed to detect radiation from cold sources. Whereas Earth observing detectors may operate in the
	range 100 – 200 K, scientific missions investigating the origin of the Universe currently aim at temperatures in the range
	of 50 mK! These cryogenic temperatures can be realized by mechanical cryocooler but in that case the vibrations caused by
	the cryocooler cause interference in the optical system. Therefore, it is attractive to limit the emitted cooler vibrations
	to an absolute minimum. At the University of Twente, we developed a vibration-free cryogenic cooling technology in an ongoing
	research effort that is largely sponsored by the European Space Agency and is carried out in cooperation with Airbus Defence
	and Space (formerly Dutch Space). This technology uses the thermodynamic Linde-Hampson cycle with Joule-Thomson expansion,
	and although this sounds quite complex, basically it is a cycle quite similar to the operating cycle of a standard kitchen
	refrigerator. The most important difference that we make is using a sorption-based thermal compressor instead of a mechanical
	compressor. The thermal compressor operates on basis of the cyclic adsorption and desorption of a working fluid on activated
	carbon. Gas is adsorbed at low pressure and by heating the carbon it is desorbed and builds up a high pressure. The high-pressure
	gas then is subsequently allowed to expand over a flow restriction in the cold stage, thus establishing a temperature drop
	in the gas. After an introduction on cooling in space, I will discuss the sorption-based cooler development at the University
	of Twente, in which we recently have established Technology Readiness Level 5.
